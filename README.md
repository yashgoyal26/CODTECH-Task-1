**Project -** DIGITAL LOGIC DESIGN WITH VERILOG

**Duration -** June to August 2024

**OBJECTIVE -**

The objective of the project is to develop digital cicuits such as logic gates , adders , multiplexer using verilog within VLSI software.
The design will be similutaed to validate with their functionality , and simulation results will be analyzed using the waveform viewer in the VLSI software to ensure accurate operation.

**KEY ACTIVITIES -**

1. Specification : Define circuit functionality and requirements.
2. Verilog Design : Create verilog module for logic gates , address , multipliers etc.
3. Coding : Write verilog code adhering to design specifications.
4. Simulation Setup : Configure simulation environment in VLSI software
5. Simulation : Execute simulation to verify circuit functionality.
6. Waveform Analysis : Analyze simulation results using waveform viewer.
7. Debugging : Identify and fix errors in Verilog code or design.
8. Verification : Ensure circuit meet specified requirements.
9. Documentation : Document design , verilog code , and simulation results.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED -**

1. Verilog : Hardware description language for specifying didgital circuits.
2. VLSI Software : Tools such as Cadence Virtuoso , Synopsys Design Compiler , or Xilinx Vivado for Verilog based design and simulations.
3. Simulation Tools : QuestaSim , or Xilinx ISim for Simulating verilog design.
4. Waveform Viewer : Built-in tool in VLSI software for visualizing and analyzing simulation results.
5. Synthesis Tools : Design complier , Vivado HLS for converting Verilog code to gate-level implementation.
6. Documentation Tools : Software for documenting design specifications , Verilog code , and simulation outcomes.
